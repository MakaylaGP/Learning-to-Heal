### Determining Economic Need <a href="#_1fgy4xh28e9o" id="_1fgy4xh28e9o"></a>

#### Locally: **Small Biz Lacks Government Backing.** <a href="#_eyvdq1ywv5ow" id="_eyvdq1ywv5ow"></a>

**What information about the perceived need is readily available?**

*
  * _‚Äú_Baltimore‚Äôs small business development systems need improved coordination, increased accountability and a more thoughtful allocation of resources.‚Äù ‚Äì [Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-md-small-business-baltimore-20211004-uqhxdwbirrcehjgukdsy7xxnqy-story.html)
  * _‚Äú_Baltimore has the potential to be a city that is truly hospitable to small business growth, with all the economic benefits of jobs and tax revenue such growth would bring. But for new and established small businesses to thrive, the city needs a financing system with capacity to meet their needs.‚Äù ‚Äì [Johns Hopkins University](https://21cc.jhu.edu/publications/reports/financing-baltimores-growth-measuring-small-companies-access-to-capital/)
  * ‚ÄúWhat is needed is a concerted effort across the city and region to promote economic inclusion.‚Äù ‚Äì [Baltimore Integration Partnership X UMMS](https://www.umms.org/ummc/-/media/files/ummc/community/bip\_economicinclusion\_fullreport\_06192018\_reducedfilesize.pdf?upd=20180702185442)

#### Regionally: **CDFIs Lack Structure & Effectiveness** <a href="#_uwitjgm6skmn" id="_uwitjgm6skmn"></a>

**What information about the perceived need is readily available?**

* ‚ÄúThis increased focus on small business lending has been driven both by participating CDFIs and by ongoing research into the limited capital available for small business development in the Baltimore region.[1](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/community\_development/community\_scope/2018/community\_scope\_2018\_issue\_2/case\_study6\_maryland#footnote1) At this point in time, the group does not have any dedicated staff or formal structure.‚Äù ‚Äì [Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond ‚ÄúMaryland CDFI Roundtable Case Study‚Äù](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/community\_development/community\_scope/2018/community\_scope\_2018\_issue\_2/case\_study6\_maryland)

### <mark style="color:blue;background-color:blue;">Creating the Solution</mark> <a href="#creating-the-solution" id="creating-the-solution"></a>

**Could a cooperative effort address these needs?**

* Yes, a cooperative effort would be charged with forming a management team to specifically oversee the allocation of accessible resources to businesses in need.
* Cooperatives have perpetual existence and therefore provide lasting change.
* Cooperatives are prevalent in the US‚Äî serving 350M members holding assets of over 3.1M, generating revenues of more than 510B, and employ more than 850k people
* A cooperative could provide the following:
  * Credit, transportation, facilities, recreational equipment, food, housing, health care, home care, child care, wholesale goods and supplies, electricity, telephone and electric services, farm production supplies and service, farm product marketing

#### What information about cooperatives is available? <a href="#_dj9qxq9w9he3" id="_dj9qxq9w9he3"></a>

* ‚ÄúThe Statement on the Cooperative Identity states that a cooperative is an ‚Äúautonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.‚Äù ‚Äì [International Cooperative Alliance](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity#definition-of-a-cooperative)
* ‚ÄúCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) are specialized community based financial institutions with a primary mission to promote economic development by providing financial products and services to people and communities underserved by traditional financial institutions, particularly in low income communities. CDFIs include community development banks and credit unions, and non-regulated institutions such as non-profit loan funds or venture capital funds‚Äù ‚Äì [CDFI.org](http://www.cdfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Maryland.pdf)
* For another presentation of the usefulness of CoOp visit[ USDA.gov](https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/publications/CIR11\_Co-opEssentialsPowerpoint.pdf)

#### Who can serve as an adviser to the group? <a href="#_mcoh9ammczkj" id="_mcoh9ammczkj"></a>

* Controlled by a Board of Directors
  * Elected by and from members

#### Who should be invited to a meeting of potential users? <a href="#_r2rmnd38gi96" id="_r2rmnd38gi96"></a>
